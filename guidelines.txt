IF you don't know how to play the game maybe you can try to use this mini guideline here. Please enjoy |_|.
In this simple implementation:

The board is displayed with rows labeled 0 to 7 and columns labeled 0 to 7.
The pieces are represented as "W" for white and "B" for black. Empty spaces are represented by spaces.
To make a move:

Enter the coordinates:

When prompted to enter the row of the piece you want to move, type a number between 0 and 7.
When prompted to enter the column of the piece you want to move, type a number between 0 and 7.
Enter the destination coordinates:

When prompted to enter the row where you want to move the piece, type a number between 0 and 7.
When prompted to enter the column where you want to move the piece, type a number between 0 and 7.
For example:

If you want to move the white piece from (row 2, column 1) to (row 3, column 2), you would enter:
Start row: 2
Start column: 1
End row: 3
End column: 2
