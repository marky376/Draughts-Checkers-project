# A readme file for a Python practical project on the Draughts game

## Overview
This is a simple text-based implementation of the Draughts game, also known as Checkers, written in Python. Players take turns moving their pieces ("W" for White, "B" for Black) on an 8x8 board, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent.

## How to Play
In this implementation:

- The board is displayed with rows labeled 0 to 7 and columns labeled 0 to 7.
- The pieces are represented as "W" for White and "B" for Black. Empty spaces are represented by spaces.

To make a move:

- **Enter the coordinates**:
  - When prompted to enter the row of the piece you want to move, type a number between 0 and 7.
  - When prompted to enter the column of the piece you want to move, type a number between 0 and 7.
- **Enter the destination coordinates**:
  - When prompted to enter the row where you want to move the piece, type a number between 0 and 7.
  - When prompted to enter the column where you want to move the piece, type a number between 0 and 7.

## Example Move
If you want to move a White piece from (row 2, column 1) to (row 3, column 2), you would enter:
- Start row: 2
- Start column: 1
- End row: 3
- End column: 2

We hope you enjoy playing the game!
